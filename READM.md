## tg-comp-challenge-2

### Overview
This project is the second of three static comp challenges that require us to build a website with only a comp to guide us. In this specific project, we were given a comp with no assets. The only requirement was that we stick to the layout. Some creative license was given to us with relation to the copy, images, icons, and the color palette.

In my version of the comp, I decided to stick closely to the original comp. I used images similar to the original comp and preceded to base my color palette off of it as well. From there I used flexbox to style my webpage.
